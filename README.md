# Hiq

Hiq is a simple Haiku generator for Ruby. It allows you to generate haikus with 5 - 7 - 5 composition.

The Haikus are generated from premade lines which in turn were generated by RNN learning from the following Haiku [collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/herval/creative_machines/master/haikuzao/src/main/resources/haiku.txt)
